BeetBox
=======

This is probably not especially useful to anyone, but may be interesting to those curious about the inner workings of the [Beetbox](http://scott.j38.net/interactive/beetbox/).

The code for interfacing with the MPR121 is based on [an Arduino example by Jim Lindblom](http://bildr.org/2011/05/mpr121_arduino/).
